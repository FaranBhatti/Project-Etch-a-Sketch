# Project-Etch-a-Sketch
Browser Etch-a-Sketch game. Mostly to practice DOM manipulation and JS

Didn't really attempt to style it too much. Was basically more focussed on logic implementation.


Three buttons:

1. Clear Screen - Just clears the current canvas
2. Rainbow mode - The sketch pad colors random rgb values each grid location. If the button is red its off and if the button is green its on.
3. Change grid - Allows the user to change the grid size of the canvas. The canvas is 450x450 pixels so the user can only input integers that divide evenly into that.
